Design an agent as the player which operates the tank in Battle City.
Your agent must survive 3 stages.
Make sure that your agent do not crash the game in N stages. 
Place the agent program in ai.py. 
In each iteration, your ai agent need to determine the direction of the tank and whether it will fire a bullet or not according to the map information given by the program.
The agent cannot slow down the program.
An agent which operates the tank randomly will be graded as 0.
You can add objects, functions in class ai_agent or import any basic libraries.
If you  want to include libraries which require installations, please contact TA to see if the liararies can be used in this project.
